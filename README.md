## ✅ Project Overview

This project is divided into 4 individual tasks, each focusing on a core area of cybersecurity:

---

### 1️⃣ Network Sniffer (Python-Based)

- **Goal:** Capture and inspect live network packets.
- **Tools Used:** Python, `scapy`, and `socket` libraries.
- **Features:**
  - Real-time packet sniffing.
  - Filtering by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
  - Header parsing and basic analysis.
- **Output:** Logs captured traffic to console or file.
